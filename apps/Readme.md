# Applications

Here we provide several applications providing different methodologies to perform approximate nearest neighbor search.

## Distributed E2LSH

Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing (E2LSH) was proposed by Alexandr Andoni and Piotr Indyk. Here we perform a distributed construction of E2LSH.
Examples will be introduced in the E2LSH app.
